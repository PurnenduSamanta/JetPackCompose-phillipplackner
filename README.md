# Documentation:
To run a particular Activity just change the full path name of the Activity in manifest file be like:
if you want to run CircularProgressBar then in between Activity tag just change the name as  android:name=".CircularProgressBar"
or if you want to run MeditationUi then change it to android:name=".meditation_ui.MeditationUi".That's it.
